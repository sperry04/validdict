## Validation Results

# TODO: add "PARENT" outcome that would inherit the parent's outcome for nested validators
#       not sure how to handle that since the parent/child relationship is not explicit,
#       but maybe during the generation of a ResultSet, as Results are chained together there
#       could be some sort of hand-off of valid/invalid Outcomes?
# IDEA: since ResultSets are flat without a parent/child relationship, the path in each
#       Result would be the only way to find parents.  Instead of building/maintaining a 
#       tree, we could just index each path into a dict of path->outcome and scan the
#       dict by removing breadcrumbs until there's a non-Outcome.PARENT value, or we hit the
#       root with defaults of PASS/FAIL for valid/invalid.
# BUT:  how to handle that the path->outcome mapping should be per-ResultSet (maybe?) but the
#       paths/outcomes are in the Result, and the Result has no relationship to one or more
#       ResultSets that might contain it?  I don't want to add in some weird reference to each
#       Result... and it can't be a global lookup because there could be two schemas with 
#       matching key names that would cause path collisions.
